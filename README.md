# SecuritySpy Command Line Interface (SecSpyCLI)

This app was written as a way to test and provide example usage of the
[securityspy](https://github.com/golift/securityspy) library.
This app will be updated slowly as I feel like adding new feature.

If you have feature requests or bug reports, please open an Issue.
