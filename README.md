SecuritySpy Command Line Interface (secspy)
---

This app was written as a way to test and provide example usage of the
[securityspy](https://github.com/golift/securityspy) library.
This app will be updated slowly as I feel like adding new feature.

If you have feature requests or bug reports, please open an Issue.

Install with homebrew.
```shell
brew tap golift/mugs
brew install golift/mugs/secspy
secspy --help
```

Or use a docker image.
```shell
docker pull golift/secspy:stable
docker run golift/secspy:stable --help
```

You can install on Linux with a DEB or RPM.
Those are on the [Releases](https://github.com/davidnewhall/secspy/releases) page.
